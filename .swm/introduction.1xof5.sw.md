## **Why Three.js?**

When I started learning Three.js, I didn't have many resources. The library was flourishing, but it was without a doubt new, and there appeared to be considerable gaps in the documentation. At that time, we had to push through and dig into the code and examples, find threads about frequent problems, and keep trying until it worked. Nowadays, the documentation is excellent. We have pretty decent tutorials and the library is stable, even though it's still evolving thanks to the community. Yet, an ultimate course that takes you by the hand was still missing. It would help if you had guidance to fully understand this subject and get enough experience to do your projects without struggling or getting lost. After I launched my portfolio, many people asked me if I could tutor them or where to learn the techniques I use. I had in-depth knowledge of Three.js and I knew how to teach. When I got all those requests, I figured it was time to build that online course for everyone to explore. Three.js is vast, and you can do an infinite number of things with it.

The content is separated into chapters and is intended for absolute beginners. If you know nothing about WebGL and Three.js but want to create cool 3D websites, you’ve come to the right place. Some of you might be tempted to jump straight to specific chapters. Yes, I’m talking to you, you React developer! If you are in a hurry or just eager to learn advanced topics, be my guest and try. Still, my recommendation is to learn the lessons one by one in order. Anyway, if it’s too hard, you can still go back to a previous chapter. As I’ve mentioned earlier, the course is separated into chapters. Let’s talk a little about each one in order to help you apprehend what’s coming. In the first chapter, we will learn all the basics, such as creating a first scene, rendering it, adding objects, choosing the right materials, adding textures, animating everything and even put it online. Some might find this part a bit boring since we enumerate a lot of elements. Don’t worry, the fun and creative parts are coming. In the next chapter, we will go through many classic techniques: for instance, creating our own geometries, adding lights and shadows, interacting with 3D objects, and adding particles. That’s where things get a little more exciting. In the third chapter, we will learn more advanced techniques and even stray away from WebGL and Three.js, by learning how to create our own 3D models using Blender. That's right! You'll also learn how to use Blender during this course. You’ll also learn how to add physics using the library I used for my portfolio. And I’ll even teach you how I personally organise my code for big projects. In the fourth chapter, we are going to talk about shaders. If you’ve already heard about shaders, you probably know this is where people start to struggle, and for good reason. Shaders are hard, but shaders will unlock the true power of WebGL. You’ll be able to create things that would seem impossible at first. If you don’t understand what I’m talking about, don’t worry, everything will make sense once you finish this chapter. In the fifth chapter, we will go the extra mile with even more advanced techniques, such as post-processing, performance optimisation, and how to mix WebGL with HTML. In the sixth chapter, we will learn how to create a scene like the one you see on the homepage of Three.js Journey. It’s not going to be the same scene because the chapter would have been way longer and boring, but the techniques are exactly the same and you’ll be able to create any kind of scene after that. And finally, in the seventh chapter, we will learn how to use Three.js in a React application with React Three Fiber. I know many of you are excited about this and I’m sure you’ll love this part. The number of techniques you’ll learn and practice is huge. You’ll even create a game with physics, real game mechanics, UI, and cool effects. Oh and, if you don’t know React, don’t worry, I’ve got you covered. There is a 4-hour long lesson dedicated to learning React basics. That’s a bonus. You came to learn Three.js and you’ll learn a bunch of other things along the way. Because I'm a creative developer, I'll also do my best to help you create elegant experiences. I'll give you many tips and tricks to find the perfect tweaks for your WebGL creations.

## **How to study Three.js?**

Difficulty As you go through the lessons, you’ll see that things get harder. You will struggle, but don't worry, it's perfectly normal. No one can understand everything on the first try. The first thing to understand is that, if it’s hard to learn, it’s valuable knowledge (or a bad teacher), so keep up. Secondly, yes we approach challenging topics, but then we practice. After tackling challenging topics multiple times, it’ll start to make sense.

Find out how you can learn the best each individual has a unique way to learn. It's a valuable lesson for you to find out how you can get the most out of this course. Find the moment of the day where you learn best. For me, it’s in the morning. Do not try to rush things and complete the whole course in only one week.

The brain needs time to process items, and it does it best at night. Maybe try one or two (three tops) lessons a day. Eat well, sleep enough, drink, and stay healthy. And don't forget to shut down any distractions. Some people like to first focus on the lesson without doing anything else and then try to do the exercise themselves while going back to the lesson with which they struggle.

Code Each developer has a personal way of coding and I have mine. During the lesson, the code will follow my personal preferences. Do as you wish. If you want to refactor all the code, go ahead. You can even use a code beautifier that will automatically reformat your code.

Prerequisite<br/>
You need a computer on which you can install software and code. Some course portions might vary depending on the OS, like the Terminal commands or some Blender shortcuts. I'll always provide the MacOS and Windows versions.

This doc is beginner-friendly, yet you do need to know JavaScript basics like variables, array, objects, loops, functions, and events. You will also need a code editor. I recommend Visual Studio Code because it's a well-oiled editor with a broad community and extended updates coming every month. However, you can use the editor that suits you. There will be a few instances when we install plugins, but again, it won't be a big deal, and you'll probably find corresponding plugins for your code editor.

Another requirement is a modern browser with useful developer tools. I'll be using Chrome, but you can also use Firefox. Please don’t use Safari or Edge.

They do the trick when it comes to navigating, but not when it comes to debugging. At some point, we will install Chrome extensions, but those extensions are optional. Also, be careful with browsers that implement special security and privacy features like Brave. They might interfere with your code.

We will also learn how to use Blender. It's a piece of free 3D software that works on every primary OS, and it's just great. If you are curious, give it a try already. You don't need to be good at maths. I'm terrible at it, and still, I manage to create cool WebGL experiences. Yes, being good at it would be a plus, but you can do without it, and I'll explain the formulas. Finally, if you know nothing about Three.js, you're in the right place.

## **Post your work**

You are here to learn how to create 3D websites, right?

You don’t have to finish the whole course to create nice projects. After a few reads, you’ll see that you’ll have sufficient knowledge to venture out on your own and have some fun. But what is it worth if you can’t share it with the world?

Well, good news, in the Go Live doc page, you’ll learn how to put your projects online for free.

You can also post on the Doppa Discord server which is ideal if you want some feedback from the team.
