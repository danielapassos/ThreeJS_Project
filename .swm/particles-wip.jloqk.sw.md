Particles are precisely what you expect from that name. They are very popular and can be used to achieve various effects such as stars, smoke, rain, dust, fire, and many other things.

The good thing with particles is that you can have hundreds of thousands of them on screen with a reasonable frame rate. The downside is that each particle is composed of a plane (two triangles) always facing the camera.

Creating particles is as simple as making a [Mesh](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/objects/Mesh). We need a [BufferGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/core/BufferGeometry), a material that can handle particles ([PointsMaterial](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/PointsMaterial)), and instead of producing a [Mesh](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/objects/Mesh) we need to create a [Points](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/objects/Points).
