For our first doc, we will make Three.js works the most straightforward way: no bundler, no dependency, no modules, just an HTML file, and some JavaScript.

<br/>

## **Base files**

To begin, create a plain `index.html` file:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>03 - Basic Scene</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script src="./script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

**HTML**

And a simple `script.js` file:

```
console.log('Hello Three.js')
```

Open the `index.html` in your browser. To do that, you can try to double click on the file. If it doesn't work or it opens with the wrong browser, you can drag and drop the file onto the right browser. Even if Three.js will work on most browsers, I recommend using a developer-friendly browser like **Chrome** or **Firefox**.

Now open the **Developer Tools**.

To do that, you can right click anywhere on the page and choose `Inspect` or you can press `F12` on Windows and `CMD + OPTION + I` on MacOS.

Then navigate to the **Console** tab on top of the **Developer Tools**.

You should keep the **Console** open at all time to see potential errors and warnings.
