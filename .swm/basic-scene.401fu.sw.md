For our first doc, we will make Three.js works the most straightforward way: no bundler, no dependency, no modules, just an HTML file, and some JavaScript.

<br/>

## **Base files**

To begin, create a plain `index.html` file:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>03 - Basic Scene</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script src="./script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

**HTML**

And a simple `script.js` file:

```
console.log('Hello Three.js')
```

Open the `index.html` in your browser. To do that, you can try to double click on the file. If it doesn't work or it opens with the wrong browser, you can drag and drop the file onto the right browser. Even if Three.js will work on most browsers, I recommend using a developer-friendly browser like **Chrome** or **Firefox**.

Now open the **Developer Tools**.

To do that, you can right click anywhere on the page and choose `Inspect` or you can press `F12` on Windows and `CMD + OPTION + I` on MacOS.

Then navigate to the **Console** tab on top of the **Developer Tools**.

You should keep the **Console** open at all time to see potential errors and warnings.

<br/>

## **How to load Three.js**

Now we need to load the Three.js library. There are many ways of doing it. For now, we will simply download the library and load it using <script>.

Go to https://threejs.org/ and click on the download button to download a zip file and unzip it. The file is quite heavy, but don't worry, we only need one file from it.

You should get a folder that looks like this:

<br/>

<div align="center"><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/swimmio-content/o/repositories%2FZ2l0aHViJTNBJTNBVGhyZWVKU19Qcm9qZWN0JTNBJTNBZGFuaWVsYXBhc3Nvcw%3D%3D%2Fc9338c45-f9eb-4062-b52d-c9f78f79dab4.png?alt=media&token=a1775de1-7e09-47c0-9296-49c73640292f" style="width:'50%'"/></div>

<br/>

Go to the build/ folder and copy the three.min.js file to your project. You should get something like this:

<br/>

<div align="center"><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/swimmio-content/o/repositories%2FZ2l0aHViJTNBJTNBVGhyZWVKU19Qcm9qZWN0JTNBJTNBZGFuaWVsYXBhc3Nvcw%3D%3D%2Ffdf3a5aa-b470-4d73-92a2-0073fabfede1.png?alt=media&token=58f05e1b-42c5-457c-8a58-308b813cd202" style="width:'25%'"/></div>

<br/>

We can now load the Three.js library at the end of the `<body>`, right before closing it:

```
<script src="./three.min.js"></script>
<script src="./script.js"></script>
```

Make sure to load `three.min.js` before your `script.js`; otherwise, your script will not be aware of what's inside the `three.min.js` file.
